# Welcome to RealTest
This is a personal project where i tried to do a real test which go from basic education to major level, i have just 1 test (maths), this project also works as first learning reactjs personal job.
This project is over for now, i wanna add some test more later when i found motivation, but all the functional code is working like i wanna to do.
## If you want to prove it, you will need:
nodejs (npm)
npm install (in directory, for react scripts)
npm start
Enjoy it!
